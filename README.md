# Time Series Analysis &amp; Forecasting of GridTrades
GUI-assisted EDA &amp; visualization using DTale. 

## Introduction
Historical Grid Trade Master Agreements (GTMA) data is accessed from https://data.nationalgrideso.com/, the data portal of the UK National Grid ESO (UK NGESO). This project is **supported by National Grid ESO Open Data**.
The GTMA's represent the planned trades that the UK NGESO conducts to maintain grid balance & security, . This function is auxillary to the balancing mechanism.

This project , in order to learn more how to make the most out of these libraries / modules.

### Objective
* Practice time series analysis on real-world data, from data preprocessing up until forecasting.
* Practice on GUI-assisted EDA &amp; visualization using DTale.
* Practice model optimization with pmdARIMA.
